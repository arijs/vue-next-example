# Vue-Next-Example

This example uses a fork of Vue 3 - [@arijs/vue-next](https://github.com/arijs/vue-next/tree/lazy-load-assets) to enable the dynamic, asynchronous and lazy loading of components without the need of a transpiler like Webpack.

Your application code is not compiled at all, you save and reload your browser like in the good old times 😁. Components are loaded on the runtime only at the moment they are needed.

## How to run

```
npm install

npm start
```

And open your browser on http://localhost:8070
